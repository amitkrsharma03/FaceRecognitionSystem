## 🧪 How it Works

1. **Enrollment Phase**
   - Student image is captured from frontend.
   - Image is sent to backend (optional: saved for logging).
   - Face embedding is generated and stored securely via FaceIO or similar.

2. **Recognition Phase**
   - Live face is scanned and compared.
   - Closest match is returned with confidence score.
   - Matching student details are fetched and displayed.

3. **Admin View**
   - Lookup any student by ID or face.
   - See logs of previous authentications.
